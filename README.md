# **Zindi - SUA Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge**

In Tanzania, climate-sensitive waterborne diseases such as **typhoid, amoebiasis, diarrhoea, schistosomiasis, and intestinal worms** pose significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations like women and children. These diseases are exacerbated by **poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, and changing climate patterns**, disproportionately affecting communities with limited access to healthcare.

With a specific region in Tanzania as the focus, the lack of predictive tools hinders timely interventions, leaving these populations at greater risk. The objective of this challenge is to develop a **machine learning model** that can predict **outbreaks of climate-sensitive waterborne diseases** using datasets comprising **water sources, toilet quality, waste management, health facility data, and climate information from 2019 to 2023**.
